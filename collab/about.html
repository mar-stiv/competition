  <h2>Nowadays we are more aware about global warming but does everyone know the consequences?<h2>

  <p></p>

    <h3>In the latest years, the number of people that have health problems are increasing.  Air pollution can cause lung problems,
      for example; asthma attacks, bronchial diseases and allergies. Unfortunately, that is not all, air pollution can also cause skin
      cancers and even vision problems. Sea pollution is also a huge deal when it comes to helping our environment. A lot of plastic
      and rubbish is being thrown into the sea which is causing a serious threat to the aquatic life. </h3>
